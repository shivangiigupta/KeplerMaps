Geospatial data refers to the time-based data that is related to a specific location on the Earthâ€™s surface. It is useful since it can reveal vital patterns and trends in the landscape. There are many libraries available to analyze such data, but often there is a lot of manual effort involved. Memory management of geospatial data is another issue. This means the magnitude of such data makes it a little difficult to process and analyze it easily.
Kepler.gl is a powerful open source geospatial analysis tool for large-scale data sets. Developed by Uber, Kepler.gl is a data-agnostic and high-performance web-based application for large-scale geolocation data sets. You very easily find patterns in a dataset, combine different datasets, perform aggregations and manipulations in real-time. If a dataset has a timestamp, geopoints, and some meta information, Kepler.gl can automatically extract the information and visualize it.
